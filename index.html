    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Jack Davis, I am a computer science student at Kent State University</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I got into programming when I was in grade school, I used to play very monotonous games like Toontown Online. 
      I wished to find a way to automate these games and found a coding language called Autoit. 
      After tinkering with it and making some basic bots I started looking more and more into programming, leading me to Python my main language of choice.</p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>I've worked two summer jobs related to computer science. 
      The first one I was a camp instructor for a STEM camp. I taught kids age 8-16 how to program Lego Mindstorm robots.
      The second one was a project for QM consortium, where we used a flask webserver and postgresql to create a website for them.
